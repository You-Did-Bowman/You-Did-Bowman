## Building Web Visions, One Line of Code at a Time! 🖥️

Hello, my name is Judith Bohmann.
<br><br>
🔭 I'm currently working on further developing my theoretical and practical knowledge of web development. 
I already feel quite comfortable with HTML, CSS and SCSS - I have also already worked with bootstraps. Projects - based solely on these technologies - can be found here:
- link to project 1
- link to project 2
<br><br>

🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript. Building on that, I'm going to learn React.js. To get a current overview of my knowledge, you should take a look at my latest project:

<br><br>

🌈 I’m aiming to build a strong foundation in web development by June 2025, with the goal of being fully prepared for the demands of the job market. Until then, I’m focused on deepening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to confidently take on real-world projects.
