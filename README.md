## Building Web Visions, One Line of Code at a Time! üñ•Ô∏è

Hello, my name is Judith Bohmann.
<br><br>
üî≠ I'm currently working on further developing my theoretical and practical knowledge of web development. 
I already feel quite comfortable with HTML, CSS and SCSS - I have also already worked with bootstraps. Projects - based solely on these technologies - can be found here:
- Final project for the module "<b>UI Basics</b>": <a href="https://github.com/You-Did-Bowman/portfolio">Draft of my portfolio</a>
<br><br>

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning <b>Javascript</b>. Building on that, I'm going to learn React.js. To get a current overview of my knowledge, you should take a look at my latest project:
- <a href="https://github.com/You-Did-Bowman/JavaScript-Practice">Tasks that I complete in addition to my daily tasks in further education at DCI</a>

- Final project for the module "<b>Programming Basics</b>": <a href="https://github.com/You-Did-Bowman/MASTERMIND_digital">Terminal based game - Mastermind</a>

- RGB-Guessing-Game: <a href="https://github.com/You-Did-Bowman/RGB_Guessing_Game"> Repo: RGB-Guessing-Game</a> / <a href="https://you-did-bowman.github.io/RGB_Guessing_Game/"> Github-Page: RGB-Guessing-Game</a>
<br><br>

üåà I‚Äôm aiming to build a strong foundation in web development by June 2025, with the goal of being fully prepared for the demands of the job market. Until then, I‚Äôm focused on deepening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to confidently take on real-world projects.
